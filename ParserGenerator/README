This code is messy and still super hacked together for a prototype.


Basically it has two stages. the first stage is launches a selenium browser, opens every web page in urls.txt and attempts to find the strings in urls.txt

The second stage creates a classifier that can automatically extract the given text.

Execute The following steps:

1. Go to target site, copy url and three sentences from the section you want
2. Place the text in file in the format
  [url]|[text1]|[text2]|[text3]
3. Launch Selenium Server
4. python webprofiler.py
5. python classifier.py
6. Up to two guesses at the correct classifier will be output. Pick the one that fits you need.
7. Optionally flesh out a rename function that helps determine the url required to fetch the comments
