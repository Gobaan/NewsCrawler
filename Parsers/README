This crawler is designed to crawl news articles. There are two seperate crawlers depending on whether you want to use the Bing API or the less legit Google result parser.

  python googleBlogSearch.py [query start_month start_year end_month end_year]

The extra fields are due to google offering finer control over the query

Dependencies:
   BeautifulSoup
